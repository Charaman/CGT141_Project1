    <h1>You've Escaped!</h1>
    <p>You have slipped out of the Red Lotus Internet Casino without spending a single dime—an accomplishment few can brag about. But don’t let the fresh air fool you. Your escape is only the beginning. The real terrors stir beneath the casino’s neon glow, waiting for anyone bold—or foolish—enough to continue onward.
        <br>
        <br>
    Down there, you’ll be hunting for the next clue buried deep within your own thoughts, the kind that only surfaces when the lights flicker and the room goes quiet. Consider this a momentary victory, a breath before the plunge.
    <br>
    <br>
    For now, I commend your resolve. These trials would break the common wanderer, yet here you stand—uneasy, uncertain, but undeniably brave.
    <br>
    <br>
    Until our paths cross again in the shadows below… good luck. You’re going to need it.</p>
