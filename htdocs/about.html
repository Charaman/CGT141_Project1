        <p>________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p> Designed by 5 Red Lotus Graduates, this isn't a game. This is a recreation of the Red Lotus Casino as an Internet Game Website. This explores 5 of the various attractions offered at the Red Lotus Casino.</p>
        <p class="title">Lore:</p>
        <p>________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p> When the petals of the Red Blossom,
            when the moon's light shine on the Reddish Gem Core,
            when the fairies of the red moon take the flower of great sanctity,
            The casino shall operate,
            Operate no more but more than before,
            Under no reason shall it therefore fall, until its predetermined end date,
            the date when the red lotus withers, its gem core shattering into motes of pixie dust.

        <p>Red Lotus Casino isn't Real, if it wasn't clear. We are not affiliated with any real life casino - this is just a project to explore making a website. Red Lotus Internet Casino & Red Lotus Casino is just an extension of that. We do not condone the notion of gambling at all. No matter what our website might state about gambling or about casinos please do not take it as an invitation to actually start gambling. It will only harm you in the long run. Please do not gamble.</p>
        <p>We also do not condone the usage of any liquors or alcohols of any sorts in any setting. Much like gambling it will also hurt you and is also a form of addiction. Do not take any word on our website as an invitation to drink alcohol. </p>
        <p>Again we do not condone gambling & liquor drinking. Don't treat anything on this website as an invitation to drink or gamble. Both of them are injurious to your health & life. Know the risks.</p>
        <p>If you are curious as to what makes casinos addictive please take a look at this blog from gateway foundation - https://www.gatewayfoundation.org/blog/casino-psychology/.</p>
