        <p>________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Envisioned by five college freshman who wanted to develop a website that explores an escape room with various themed puzzles, all based off of an old timey casino. This site will take the user (you), through 5 different rooms, each with their own respective puzzle designed around an actual thing you would find in a casino. </p>

        <p>You wake up to many casino sounds, the smell of cigarettes, and an undeniable stench of a bottomless shrimp bar in the next room over. 
            You adjust your eyes to find yourself strapped to a slot machine chair, with a number padlock seeming to be your only way out.
            How long has it been since I entered this casino, you ask yourself. Why did I even come here, you continue to question your motives...
            You however do not have much time to regret your actions as yes, you are trapped in a chair, and yes you should most definitely find a way out of this chair.
            Before you can truly leave this casino, you must face the five challenges, all designed to stop you in your tracks. Good luck and don't look back.
