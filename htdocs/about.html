        <p>________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Made by 5 college students this website explores the concept of puzzle rooms based inside off a casino. It will take the user, you, through 5 different rooms, each with their own puzzles designed around an attraction or something within a casino. </p>

        <p>You wake up to the sounds of a casino operating in the background. 
            Your head is filled with numerous voices, voices that shout, voices that sound like coins hitting each other, and machines that are being operated.
            You look in front of you and realize that you are seated in one of the attractions. 
            You don't know how long it has been since you entered this casino. 
            You don't know why you entered a casino in the first place.
            You regret it but it's too late for them. 
            Now your only focus is on getting out of this casino and making it back home, back to your family. 
            Before that though, you must face the 5 challenges, all designed to stop you from escaping this prison dressed up as a casino.
